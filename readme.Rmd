# Rationale - Abstract

Biomass at European and Global scale has been estimated with several
approaches.

In this approach we

# Introduction

Information on above ground biomass (AGB) is important for several
applications. XXXX list here the applications.... In this work we focus
on AGB as input information for mapping fuel models (fuel types?). We
use the term fuel model as defined in [@scott2005], and in the sense
that it is then used as input to fire spread models. In [@scott2005] the
term "fuel load" AGB

Two things are important to note: (i) AGB is only one aspect of several
characteristics that concur to define a specific model, i.e. moisture
and vegetation type (citations) and (ii) the smaller components of AGB
are of higher importance for fire spread (citations).

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: material and methods
describing the input variables and the AI training phase,

# Materials and Methods

## Data

The following data sources are used. The main source was via Google
Earth Engine (GEE) via the rgee package in R [@aybar2020]

### Dependent variables

#### Above Ground Biomass

[LINK TO DATA
HERE](https://data.ceda.ac.uk/neodc/esacci/biomass/data/agb/maps/v3.0){target="_blank"}

We usedthe biomass from ESA Biomass Climate Change Initiative
(Biomass_cci): Global datasets of forest above-ground biomass for the
year 1018, version 3

-   Year: 2018
-   Resolution: ≈100 m (actually in degrees so depends on latitude)
-   Layers:
    -   **Above ground biomass**
    -   **Above ground biomass standard error**

### Independent variables:

Also referred to as "features" or "descriptors", these are variables
that are likely to be correlated, and thus help to predict, the biomass
in a specific location.

In general obvious variables such as forest canopy cover fraction and
tree height values are used, but also more indirect variables such as
climatic variables, height above sea level, forest types etc... are used
in the machine learning predictive algorithm.

#### RADAR

##### Sentinel-1

[LINK TO DATA
HERE](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S1_GRD)

C-Band backscatter available from GEE pre-processed with Sentinel-1
Toolbox for (i) thermal noise removal (ii) radiometric calibration (iii)
terrain correction using SRTM 30 or ASTER DEM for areas greater than 60
degrees latitude, where SRTM is not available. The final
terrain-corrected values are converted to decibels via log scaling
(10\*log10(x)) . We then processed for correcting for incidence angle
using [ALOS
3D](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/JAXA_ALOS_AW3D30_V3_2)
which has an accuracy \<10m for height values as well documented in
literature (<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7730400> - )

Further processing was done to aggregate over time and space. Time-wise
the Sentinel-1 backscatter from VV and VH polarizations were aggregated
with median values over the summer months of the year 2020 (01 June 2020
to 01 September 2020. This was done to minimize the effect, on
backscatter RADAR values, of snow and ice in the canopy at higher
elevation and on higher latitudes.

##### ALOS PALSAR

[LINK TO DATA
HERE](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/JAXA_ALOS_PALSAR_YEARLY_SAR)

SAR backscatter, corrected by incidence angle , is related to the amount
of vegetation available in the illuminated area. We then process the
data to gamma naught via log scaling 10\*log10(DN) - this is to compare
with Sentinel-1 values which are also corrected for incidence angle and
converted to gamma naught with the same log scaling function.

## Data pre-processing

Data collection and preparation was carried out in **Google Earth
Engine** API called from R rgee library.

### Data Coordinate Reference System harmonization

Global data are usually in geographic coordinate systems
(CRS=EPSG:4326). Some data in Europe are in EPSG:3035 (Lambertian
Conical Projection).

To harmonize between these two CRS the nearest neighbour resampling was
applied to convert

### Masking non-burnable areas

First we mask the LULC map removing non-burnable areas as per Scott and
Burgan NB(1,2,3) etc...

All data were reprojected to geographic WGS84 (EPSG:4326) coordinates
with ≈100 m

≈200'000 sample points for each tile were taken from the area by
stratified sampling using, as strata, the 13 LULC classes and biomass
classes at 10 Mg/ha intervals, for a total of 48 biomass classes. This
allowed for a balanced representation of different land use (grassland
to thick forest) and of estimated biomass at pixel level.

## Artificial Intelligence

We used ensemble of machine learning methods from R-CRAN "h2o" library
[@h2o_DL_booklet; @h2o_R_package], using a rich set of descriptors.

## Training AI

AGB data are not easily acquired as ground truth requires measuring in
the field dendrometric variables (DBH and tree heights) over a large
area, and then applying the necessary biomass models **(citation here)**
to convert these to AGB. Commonly forest plots are circular and much
smaller than the 1 ha unit that is the average resolution of the AGB
map.

Also the sampling protocols are different from country to country, and
national inventories are carried out at different times. Another factor
to is that many countries are not providing the information as open
data.

Some dedicated EU projects **(other projects here)**, such as GLOBIOMASS
[@santoro2021a], were funded with the main goal to create biomass maps.
AGB values from this map were used for training, testing and initial
validation. We will refer to these data as AGB2018 as the latest dataset
is for 2018 with version 3 providing Mg/ha values across the world.

The training samples were extracted by stratified sampling of both the
land cover and the biomass, in order to have a balanced representation
across vegetation land cover classes and biomass values. For LC only
vegetation classes are selected, with a target of 3000 sampling points
randomly defined for each class. Biomass values were clustered in
classes of 10 Mg/ha, by dividing the biomass value by 10 and truncating
to an integer value. This provided with an average of 30 classes as
biomass values range from zero to 300 Mg/ha in most of Europe. For each
biomass class a target of 6000 samples was extracted. At the end of the
process, for the 21 tiles, about 4 million samples over estimated
vegetation areas with different land cover and across the interval of
biomass values are available for training, testing and validating.

![Training points divided by
tile](man/images/trainingPoints.jpg){width="913"}

So to summarize, 50 features where used all resampled at 100 m
resolution except the climatic features:

-   19 climatic variables at 1 km resolution

-   1 topographic feature, Earth surface elevation from ALOS

-   2 canopy features, canopy height and canopy cover fraction

-   2 vegetation indices EVI and NDVI from Landsat 8

-   5 Land Cover maps, 1 providing a land cover class and 4 with
    fractions of vegetation classes (forest, shrubland, grassland and
    agriculture),

-   4 RADAR backscatter features, 2 from ALOS and 2 Sentinel-1,
    co-polarized and cross-polarized

-   16 vegetation types + 1 overall vegetation class of type with
    highest probability

The plot below shows the relation between the variables and the biomass.

<img src="man/images/variables.jpg" id="id1" style="width:500px;"/>

The rationale behind this decision is that the dependent variable, i.e.
the AGB, is mapped with a well-documented uncertainty via the 2018 CEDA
biomass map. By collecting a large number of samples from the area with
stratified sampling that accounts for land-cover type and biomass class,
we will augment available training data from ground samples.

### Variable importance

The plots below are variable importance from the random forest and the
gradient boosting methods of the ensamble pf machine learning methods.

<img src="man/images/variable_importance.png" id="id5" style="width:700px;"/>

## Testing AI

Testing was done by keeping a random sample of 25% of points on an
independent set of locations, sampled just like the training points
(stratified the same way), provided the following performance metrics
for biomass (Mg/ha):

MSE: \| 1421 RMSE: \| 38.7 MAE: \| 25.6

## Post processing

### Tiles

30 km tiles were also used for smaller downloads. for this the
harmonized tiles from the project CEF Telecom project 2018-EU-IA-0095
(www.opendatascience.eu)\
[GeoHarmonizer GitLAB repository
here](https://gitlab.com/geoharmonizer_inea/spatial-layers) were used.

## Problems and solutions

### Alignment

Cropping, clipping and reprojecting often leads to misalignment of
raster grid, adding uncertainty to data spatial relationship - see image
below. To avoid this, care must be applied when using such tools to keep
the same reference grid.

<img src="man/images/misalignment.png" style="width:500px;"/>

### Data size

Maximum size of data tables in R is about 2 billion elements. A 100 m
resolution raster of Western Europe (Spain + Portugal) as in figure
below, has about 48 million cells with biomass above 0 Mg/ha. R has a
limit of vector size, therefore to avoid this and to make full use of
parallel processing, we divided in chunks of 10 million cells for the
prediction step.

## UPDATES

-   11 Dec. 2022 - migration of all code to R thanks to "rgee" library.
-   14 Dec. 2022 - convert all to CRS 4326 (geographic) with exact
    alignment to the CEDA Biomass 2018 map [@santoro2021] that is used
    for training. NB the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area Coordinate
    Reference System) [@annoni2001] would allow all cells to be
    effectively 1 ha (100 m x 100 m), but we decided to keep a global
    reference frame for future developments outside Europe.
